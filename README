Video and audio file fetcher (with optional conversion)

This is a simple wrapper around the quvi library. The quvi library is used to get the media (video or audio) file url associated with a web site url (like youtube).

Dependencies:
- libquvi
- curl and ffmpeg installed (and in your $PATH)


Usage examples:

Download a video from youtube, saving it in it's original format (probably .webm or .flv):
$ ./vidfetch "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7uyKYeGPdE"

Download a video from youtube and convert it to .avi:
$ ./vidfetch -avi "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7uyKYeGPdE"

Extract the music from a youtube video, saving it as mp3:
$ ./vidfetch -mp3 "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7uyKYeGPdE"
